# generator-manati-theme

> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator to create a base [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) 7 Theme developed by [Estudio Manatí](http://www.estudiomanati.com/)

## Note
This is a very new generator and needs some more testing and work, so please use at your own risk, PRs welcome.

## Install
To install generator-manati-theme from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-manati-theme
```

If you don't have grunt and yeoman already installed:
```bash
npm install -g yo grunt-cli
```

## Usage
Go to your Drupal `sites/all/themes/` folder and run

```bash
yo manati-theme
```

You'll have to provide a theme name and a description, you can use plain text for the name and we'll do everything else.

You'll get a nice Live Reload installed, served by grunt and understood by drupal to react to changes in your localhost dev enviroment.  You can opt out of this feature when you run the generator.

If you don't want yeoman to run npm install for you, use the `--skipInstall` option

```bash
yo manati-theme --skipInstall
```

##Features
This generator will create a **base** theme with very little *and very useful* style.  

The intention is that the work team has a very robust and feature rich workbench to develop a Drupal theme, taking advantage of modern tools like **grunt**, **livereload** and **sass**, but don't waste a lot of time removing style that won't be used or that is going to be different.

####Grunt
The workflow is based around [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and comes preconfigured with the following features:

- [grunt-sass](https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-sass)
  - Uses libsass, no need for ruby as a dependency and much faster.
  - Includes the [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) grid framework.
  - Source files can be distributed as required in the `sass` folder, and will be compiled to the `css/style.css` single file.
  - CSS sourcemap is created.
  - *Nested* output is used in devel mode and *compressed* in production.

- [grunt-contrib-watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch)
  - Watches over *sass* and *javascript* files
  - If selected at generation time, it will run the livereload server

- [grunt-contrib-jshint](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint)
  - It will ensure that the javascript code in the src-js folder matches Manatí's code standards via the [jshint](http://jshint.com/) linter, you can modify the `.jshintrc` file created at the theme folder to match your own.

####Sass
In the `sass/` folder you'll find a series of partials that will work as the base of your theme. This has the following features:

- You can use several mixins provided by Manatí.
  - `sprite` is a mixin to reduce the code needed to use sprites
  - `font-size` adds the font-size in px units and also in rems to have better performance on zoomed browsers.
  - `hidden` will hide elements via the `clip` trick for better accessibility
  - `text-hidden` will remove the text via the `text-indent` trick for easy buttons and similar use cases
- The Neat [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) grid framework is configured to be used as a layout helper.
- RWD is already setup for you, with a *mobile first* approach
- [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) is included in the template.php file to ensure a proper and clean base.

###Javascript
We include several javascript libraries and helpers that improve the theme's compatibility with older browsers
- Javascript is aided by the following libraries:
  -[html5shiv](https://code.google.com/p/html5shiv-printshiv/)
  -[Respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond)

The theme has a src file in `src-js`, this is where you want to add your code, then grunt will lint it and minify it to the `js/script.min.js`, 


##Generated code
This is the file tree generated by this project, you can see files with the `<theme_name>` token, the generator will use the name provided by the user at generation time and deburr any non ascii chars and _snake_case_ it, so if you use *"Manatí Theme"*, `<theme_name>.info` will be `manati_theme.info`.
