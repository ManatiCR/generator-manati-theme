# generator-manati-theme [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ManatiCR/generator-manati-theme.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ManatiCR/generator-manati-theme)

> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator to create a base Drupal 7 Theme created by [Estudio Manat√≠](http://www.estudiomanati.com/)


## Install
To install generator-manati-theme from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-manati-theme
```
**This is not yet implemented as the generator has not been published yet and is not tested enough.**
To give it a try right now clone this repo and run `npm link` inside, at your own risk.

## Usage
```bash
yo manati-theme
```

You'll have to provide a theme name and a description, you can use plain text for the name and we'll do everything else.

You'll get a nice Live Reload installed, served by grunt and understood by drupal to react to changes in your localhost dev enviroment.  You can opt out of this feature when you run the generator.
